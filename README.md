# People-with-disability-participated-in-labour-force-2018

This repository facilitates the process of generating insight from disability in Australia data. Specifically the software in this repository describes how we identified : “In 2018, 53.4% of working-age (aged 15-64) people with disability participated in the Australian labour force ”. 

The disability in Australia data was collected from AIHW-People-with-disability-in-Australia-2018 (10.5281/zenodo.4939863)  Zenodo repository that contains information about people aged 15 and over living in households, by age group, gender, disability status, and labour force status in 2018. We created a Jupyter Notebook called “prepare_and_setup.ipynb” to read this data and extract insight by using Python code.
